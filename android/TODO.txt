* port to libvncclient:
  - replace wx stuff with STL/android equivalents. possible?
     +   wxthread -> pthreads
     +   NOTIFY events -> java callbacks
     +   wxString -> jstring
     +/- wxArrayString -> vector<string>, which would need O(n) conversion to Java ArrayList<String>
     +/- wxTimer/wxStopwathc -> pthreads emulation
     
  OR
  - port c++/wx stuff to java and leave only C jni stubs?
